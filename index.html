                <p>
                  Argentina won their first major title in 28 years on Saturday
                  when an Angel Di Maria goal gave them a 1-0 win over Brazil
                  and a record-equalling 15th Copa America.Di Maria got the
                  winner midway through the first half when he lobbed Ederson
                  after full back Renan Lodi failed to cut out a long through
                  ball.

                <p>
                  Brazil’s reliance on Neymar to drive the ball forward and
                  provide the bulk of their creativity was always going to be
                  their undoing, and with the Argentines using all means fair
                  and foul to ensure the #10 wouldn’t gash them, it was enough
                  to silence the hosts and the 10% capacity crowd at the
                  legendary Maracana.
